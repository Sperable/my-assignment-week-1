Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

**Answer:**
**1. Introduction of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)**
Structured programming emerged as a response to the "software crisis" of the 1960s, where software projects were often delivered late, over budget, and full of errors. The approach emphasized dividing programs into small, manageable modules with clear control structures such as loops, conditionals, and subroutines. This development marked a significant shift from "spaghetti code" practices, where programs had unstructured control flow, making them difficult to understand, debug, and maintain.
**Key Concepts:** Modularity, control flow, functions/subroutines.
**Significance:** It improved code readability, maintainability, and reliability, laying the foundation for more disciplined software development methods.

**2. Development of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s)**
Object-oriented programming introduced a new paradigm that focused on "objects" rather than procedures or functions. Objects encapsulate both data (attributes) and behavior (methods), promoting modularity, reusability, and abstraction. OOP became popular with the advent of programming languages like Smalltalk and later C++, Java, and Python. OOP enabled developers to create more modular, reusable, and maintainable code, leading to significant improvements in software development efficiency and effectiveness.
**Key Concepts:** Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
**Significance:** OOP changed how software systems were designed, allowing for better modeling of real-world entities, easier maintenance, and reuse of code. It paved the way for modern software development practices, including frameworks, libraries, and design patterns.

**3. Adoption of Agile Methodologies (2000s)**
Agile methodologies emerged in the early 2000s as a response to the limitations of the traditional Waterfall model, which had a rigid, linear approach to software development. Agile promotes iterative development, frequent feedback, collaboration, and flexibility in responding to changing requirements. The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, became the guiding document for the Agile movement.
**Key Concepts:** Iterative development, continuous feedback, collaboration, customer involvement, adaptability.
**Significance:** Agile methodologies revolutionized software development by emphasizing people, interactions, and the ability to adapt to changes quickly. This approach led to faster delivery of software products, improved customer satisfaction, and higher-quality software. It also inspired the development of related practices like DevOps, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and Lean software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

**Answer:**
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used to develop, test, and maintain software applications. It typically involves several phases:
**Planning:** This phase involves defining the project's scope, objectives, and requirements. Key activities include feasibility studies, requirements gathering, and creating a project plan.
**Design:** The design phase focuses on creating the blueprint for the software. This includes designing the system architecture, data structures, and user interface.
**Development:** In this phase, developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. Programming languages, frameworks, and tools are used to create the software.
**Testing:** Testing involves identifying and fixing defects in the software. Various testing techniques are used, such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.
**Deployment:** Once the software is tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment. This involves installing the software on servers or devices where it will be used.
**Maintenance:** After deployment, the software requires ongoing maintenance to ensure its functionality and address any issues that may arise. This includes bug fixes, updates, and enhancements.
